This guide will explain you how to download episodes using Grabber. First off, remember that **Grabber** is **not a downloader**. It just fetches the links for you.

4. IDM is now set up 👍 . Now go to a 9anime watch page. For example: [Boruto: Naruto Next Generations](https://9anime.to/watch/boruto-naruto-next-generations.97vm) and click on `Grab All` on one of the servers. (*We will use Server F4 for this guide.*).
5. Once all the links are grabbed and copied to your clipboard, IDM will automatically open the window below.
